You are given an integer array nums. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

Pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 and every element equal to nums[i] + 1.
Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 6 points.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]
Output: 9
Explanation: You can perform the following operations:
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].
You earn a total of 9 points.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 104


class Solution {
public:
    int deleteAndEarn(vector<int>& nums) {
        int N = nums.size();
        vector<int> cost(10000+1);
        
        for(int i : nums)
            cost[i] += i;
        
        for(int i=2; i<=(10000); i++){
            cost[i] = max(cost[i-1], cost[i-2]+cost[i]);
        }
        return cost.back();
    }
};
